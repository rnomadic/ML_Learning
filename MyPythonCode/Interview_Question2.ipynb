    "### 1. How you can call C function from python\n",
    "There are three key methods developers use to call C functions from their python code - **ctypes, SWIG and Python/C API**. Each method comes with it’s own merits and demerits.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Firstly, why would you want to interface C with Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A few common reasons are :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want speed and you know C is about 50x faster than Python.\n",
    "2. Certain legacy C libraries work just as well as you want them to, so you don’t want to rewrite them in python.\n",
    "3. Certain low level resource access - from memory to file interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### CTypes\n",
    "[CTypes](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html) <br>\n",
    "The Python ctypes module is probably the easiest way to call C functions from Python. The ctypes module provides C compatible data types and functions to load DLLs so that calls can be made to C shared libraries without having to modify them. The fact that the C side needn’t be touched adds to the simplicity of this method."

You use them by iterating over them, either with a ‘for’ loop or by passing them to any function or construct that iterates. Most of the time generators are implemented as functions. However, they do not return a value, they yield it. Here is a simple example of a generator function:"
